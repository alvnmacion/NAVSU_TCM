## Test Case ID: CONN-005_slow_network_performance
### Title: Slow Network Performance - App usability and loading times on slow (e.g. 3G) networks

**Summary**: Verify app usability and loading times when operating on a slow network connection.

**Preconditions**: 
- Device is connected to a slow network (e.g., 3G).

**Scenario 1**

| # | Step                                      | Expected Behavior                                       |
|---|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Use the app as normal                     | App remains usable, loading indicators appear as needed |
| 2 | Observe loading times for data fetches    | Loading times are reasonable and user is informed of delays |

**Post-conditions**:
- App remains functional and user is aware of slow network conditions.
